Hey there, neuron enthusiasts! 👋

Welcome to my deep learning blog — a place where I explore models, papers, frameworks, and whatever shiny new idea the research community drops every week.

### 🔍 What you'll find here
- Breakdowns of cool papers (because someone has to translate them into human language)  
- Implementations of models I find interesting — from simple ones to “why does this have 47 equations?”  
- Experiments, tricks, and tools from the worlds of PyTorch, JAX, and beyond  
- Occasional humor because even tensors deserve jokes  

### 🧠 Why this blog exists
Because I genuinely enjoy diving into how these models work — the math, the architecture, the weird training behaviors, all of it.  
This blog is my space to document what I learn, share insights, and explore ideas without taking things *too* seriously.

If you’re into deep learning, curious experiments, and explanations that mix clarity with a bit of personality — you’re in the right place 🚀
