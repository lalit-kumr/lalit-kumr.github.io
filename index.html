  <h1>Hey there, neuron enthusiasts! 👋</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my deep learning blog — a place where I explore models, papers, frameworks, and whatever shiny new idea the research community drops every week.</p>

  <h3 id="-what-youll-find-here">🔍 What you’ll find here</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Breakdowns of cool papers (because someone has to translate them into human language)</li>
    <li>Implementations of models I find interesting — from simple ones to “why does this have 47 equations?”</li>
    <li>Experiments, tricks, and tools from the worlds of PyTorch, JAX, and beyond</li>
    <li>Occasional humor because even tensors deserve jokes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="-why-this-blog-exists">🧠 Why this blog exists</h3>
  <p>Because I genuinely enjoy diving into how these models work — the math, the architecture, the weird training behaviors, all of it.<br />
  This blog is my space to document what I learn, share insights, and explore ideas without taking things <em>too</em> seriously.</p>

  <p>If you’re into deep learning, curious experiments, and explanations that mix clarity with a bit of personality — you’re in the right place 🚀</p>
